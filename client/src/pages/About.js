          This site is used for tracking ultimate frisbee stats. You can add
          teams and player to keep up with how they are playing. This site was
          built from scratch using React and Mongo. I made this site for the
          final project in my course. I will be revisiting this page as I learn
          more and develop my skill to make the site work better.
